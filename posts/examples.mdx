# Code highlighting
I set up code highlighting with:

* [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) is a lightweight, extensible **syntax highlighter**.
* [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus) plugin
* [`prism-themes`](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)

Example colorizing lines:
* https://codesandbox.io/s/mdx-line-numbers-code-highlighting-99wb5?file=/src/components/layout.css

Looking for lang info:
* https://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/

There are other solutions:
* https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/

TODO:
* [ ] [display lang in the title](https://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/)
* [ ] filename in the title
* [ ] tabs for code pages
* [ ] [copy to clipboard button](https://prismjs.com/plugins/copy-to-clipboard/)
* [ ] [download button](https://prismjs.com/plugins/download-button/)
* [ ] add MDX lang
* [ ] [command line](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/): `#`, `$`...

I could propabaly implemnet most of it with Prism plugins, but that require some research and work. Maybe this way:

```tsx
export default class App extends NextApp {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <ColorModeProvider value="light">
          <CSSReset />
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ColorModeProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
ls -l
```

``` javascript filename="index.js"
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  files.forEach(file => {
    console.log(file);
  });
});
```

~~~js filename="test.js"
console.log(1)
~~~

```js {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
