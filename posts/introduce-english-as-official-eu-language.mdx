# Why English?
English is already _de facto_ 2nd official language in the EU.

* It has been already widely adopted across Europe by business.
* It is used daily by the younger generation for entertainment and other media consumption purposes online.

We are already speaking English. Choosing English as official European language is just so easily duable.

# Profits
* political - this will lead to centralization that EU needs, but the soft way; we will s brigng the process of building european culture and identity on the next level - we will grow generation in european, english, infosphere
* economical -
* cultural -

# What exactly?
* official language of european union
* keeping official national languages and add additional offical language - european english
* EU would have some instittuin to decide about european english gramar
* this would be also offial political language of UE
* all UE documents in eurpean english
* and european media primaty in english


* european politics talking in european parlament in english; and this is transmited in european media; also in english

# Why language integraton?
It would be helpful for business and for EU citizens if they could do all required official tasks in English.
* Increase mobility
  * Sotware Engeneries working remotely from sotuhern europe? Having nice lifestyle? Symylating economicaly southern economies? Well paid eployyes woring remttely from exotic places?
* Open new business opportunities - business will be able to make all paper work in English, in every EU part, that helps with creating european chapions and real euripean emopyment market
*
* Decrease costs of entering to the EU market (startup from small country have bigger chanes to success because of easier access to the european market)
* Lower costs for business eg. you can sell and support in english, especially in B2B what de facto is already a fact
* Scale. It’s a huge change for eg. media and ads industries.


## Big step forward european political and cultural integration

That would be a first step for a new stage of european integration - cultural integration:
* European-scale marketing companies,
* media,
* schools and universities (teaching in English),
{/*  * European scale movies and TV series, */}

English as a common language will strengthen European integration and further shape and develop European identity.
Stronger European identity would help to stop growing euro-sceptic movements.

Even if the EU falls apart one day, it would be easier to resurect it, if it had a strong operational foundation in the form of a common language.

W PE siedzą posłowie i rozmawiają miedzy sobą za pomocą tłumaczy.
This is not serious in XXI centruey.
We can not solve our european issuse because we dont even speak the same langiange.

## Przebikmy europejskie banki informacyjne
all of that would be a platform for discussions for european countries and their politics and journalist; we REQUIRE it to:
make debate more diverse (smaller and weaker countries are not heard well enough now)
reduce separatist and nationalist sentiments
discuss more complex topics and issues that we will have to face in fast-changing world
speed up europen debate, making decisions and integration (forcing decisions by few biggest players will not work anymore, UE needs to be more inclusive)


## Real european digital market
The whole creative industry will benefit from unifying language.

## Change positon of the EU in Western world
Potentially that could motivate the UK to rejoin the EU. UK would hugely benefit from participating in an english speaking EU.
{/* opening them a way to increase trade (what is their specialization; they are struggling about leaving UE beacause it was consider as a bad deal for them; that would made it significatly better)  */}

That could open the EU to integrate more strongly with all Anglo-Saxon countries (UK, Ireland, US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia).

On other hand that will give europe a power to compete in the mass-media world build by anglo-saxons. We will be one of creators of content in this langinage.

## How could it be practically organised?

I would propose a 20-year timeline with steps: (throughout the EU)
* decide on a deadline a date when all governments will have to use english as second language
* every museum or public place should be labeled in English (4y)
* every child learn at school as a second language (6y)
* every official document should be avaliable to fill in English (10y)
  * in big cities / capitals 5-10y (we need to prepare bilingual forms)
* every teenager should obligatory pass English on maturity exam (at the same level as native level)
* court proceedings should be possible in English (20y)
